        Credentials used to <strong>scan</strong> branches and pull requests,
        <strong>check out</strong> sources and <strong>mark</strong> commit statuses.

    <p>
        Note that <strong>only "username with password"</strong> credentials are supported.
        Existing credentials of other kinds will be filtered out. This is because jenkins
        exercises OrangeForge API, and this last one does not support other ways of authentication.

        If your organization contains private repositories, then you need to specify
        a credential from an user who have access to those repositories.
