        Credentials to user to <strong>scan</strong> the selected project and its git repositories.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the moment <strong>Only "username + password"</strong> credentials are supported.
        Other types won't be proposed (esp. API key cannot be used) because Jenkins should be able to do
        both REST API calls and git http operations and only username/password with Basic Authentication
        can do that for now.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the project contains private repositories or if the project itself is private, given credentials
        should have access to this project.
    </p>
